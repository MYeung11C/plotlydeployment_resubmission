PURPOSE
In this assignment, we were to help Roza identify the top 10 bacterial species in bellybuttons. We were to do this using data and creating a horizontal bar chart, bubble chart and to create a guage chart.
This was to gather information and analyze the biological footprint of the individuals' navels.
